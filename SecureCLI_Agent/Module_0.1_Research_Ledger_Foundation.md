# Module 0.1: Research Ledger Foundation

## Prompt

Initialize the AegisCLI Research Ledger as a living markdown document. Create sections:
- Definitions (MTTR, Security Debt, Tool Sprawl, Agentic AI)
- Baselines (Pre-AegisCLI scan times, FP rates from 50 repos)
- Assumptions (CodeLlama accuracy, PaC effectiveness, Champion effect)
- Decisions Log (with date, decision, rationale, impact)
- Locked Parameters (scope, LLM model, normalization schema)
- Dependencies (scanner versions, Ollama version, Go version)

Populate with Week 0 decisions from Section J. Add placeholders for 90-day rolling telemetry policy and IRB consent form references. Output: `research-ledger/ledger-v0.md`

## Quality Gate

All terms defined with measurable units; baselines include data source paths.

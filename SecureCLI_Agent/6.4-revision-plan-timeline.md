## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path

**Week -4 (Critical Path):**
1. T11 (Section conversion) → Blocks LaTeX compilation
2. T12 (Bibliography) → Blocks citation verification (T19)
3. T02-T04 (Results tables) → Blocks Discussion section completion
4. T01 (Abstract) → Blocks submission

**Week -3 (Major Issues):**
1. M1 (External validity) → Blocks Section 8 expansion
2. M6 (Cost-benefit) → Blocks Discussion completion
3. M4 (CodeLlama comparison) → Blocks Discussion completion

**Week -2 (Threats Expansion):**
1. Section 8 expansion → Depends on M1, M2, M3 completion
2. M5 (Architecture diagram) → Independent, can proceed in parallel

**Week -1 (Polishing):**
1. LaTeX compilation → Depends on all sections complete
2. Anonymization → Can proceed in parallel
3. Proofreading → Depends on compilation complete

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Experimental Results Not Available (Week -4)

**Risk:** T02-T04 require actual experimental data that may not be collected yet.

**Mitigation:**
- Use placeholder data with clear TBD markers
- Document data collection status in TODO-master.md
- Create data collection scripts in advance
- Establish data collection deadlines (Week -5)

**Contingency:** If data unavailable, use preliminary results (P2 pilot data) with clear caveats.

---

### Risk 2: LaTeX Compilation Issues (Week -1)

**Risk:** LaTeX compilation may fail due to undefined references, figure issues, or package conflicts.

**Mitigation:**
- 3-day buffer allocated in Week -1
- Test compilation early (Week -2) to identify issues
- Use version control (Git) to track changes
- Maintain backup of working LaTeX files

**Contingency:** If compilation fails, revert to previous working version and fix incrementally.

---

### Risk 3: Architecture Diagram Generation Delays (Week -2)

**Risk:** TikZ diagram generation may require multiple iterations.

**Mitigation:**
- Start diagram generation early (Week -3)
- Use Mermaid diagrams as fallback (convert to TikZ)
- Allocate 2 days for diagram generation
- Test diagram rendering early

**Contingency:** If TikZ fails, use vector PDF export from Mermaid or hand-drawn diagram scan.

---

### Risk 4: Reviewer Response Implementation Delays (Week -3)

**Risk:** Major reviewer issues (M1, M4, M6) may require extensive analysis and writing.

**Mitigation:**
- Allocate 3 days per major issue
- Start analysis early (Week -4 preliminary work)
- Use templates from Module 6.2 response plans
- Prioritize critical issues (M1, M6) over enhancements (M4)

**Contingency:** If delays occur, prioritize M1 and M6, defer M4 to future work section.

---

# Research Agent Workflow - Step-by-step Prompt Sequence

## STEP 0 — Initialize the Project

### Prompt

You are my Research Agent. Use phase-locked execution and maintain a Research Ledger (definitions, assumptions, decisions, baselines).

**Project Inputs:**
- Research idea (raw): [paste]
- Domain/area: [paste]
- Paper type: [Empirical / Systems / Theoretical / Survey / Mixed]
- Target venue (optional): [paste]
- Constraints (time/compute/data/ethics/tools): [paste]
- Preferred contribution style: [New method / New dataset / New theory / New system / Replication+insight / Benchmark]
- Evaluation setting: [Simulation / Real-world / Lab / User study / Public dataset / New data]
- Citation style: [IEEE / ACM / APA / etc.]
- Depth mode: [Fast / Standard / Deep]

Begin PHASE 1 only.
Output using the standard response template.

## STEP 1 — PHASE 1: Idea Refinement & Research Foundation

### Prompt

**PHASE 1: Idea Refinement & Research Foundation**

1) Deconstruct the idea: problem, stakeholders, why now, feasibility constraints.

2) Write a tight gap statement using the template:
   > "Current approaches to [problem] typically [pattern], but struggle with [limitations]. We propose [approach] to achieve [measurable improvements] under [constraints]."

3) Generate 3–6 research questions:
   - 1 Primary RQ
   - 2–4 Technical RQs
   - 1–2 Validation RQs

4) Draft 3–5 contribution claims.

5) Propose: 3 title options + abstract skeleton + paper outline (tailored to my paper type).

6) Create Research Ledger v1.

**Do not start Phase 2.**

---

## STEP 2 — Lock Decisions Before Literature Review

### Prompt

Before Phase 2, list the minimum author decisions needed to avoid wasted SLR work.

Give options with pros/cons for each decision (e.g., scope boundaries, target baselines, evaluation setting, datasets).

Then wait.

---

## STEP 3 — PHASE 2: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Protocol

### Prompt

**PHASE 2: Systematic Literature Review (SLR)**

**A) Define the SLR protocol:**
- Sources/databases to use (field-appropriate)
- Search strings + synonyms
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Quality assessment rubric

**B) Propose 3–6 thematic clusters for organizing papers.**

**C) Output a "Paper Collection Plan":**
- What to search first
- How many papers per cluster (target)
- How to snowball citations (backward/forward)

Stop after protocol + plan. Do not summarize papers yet.

---

## STEP 4 — PHASE 2: Literature Cards (Key Papers)

### Prompt

Continue PHASE 2.

For each cluster, produce structured "paper cards" for the most important works (at least 5–10 total to start):
- Citation
- Core idea + method
- What it proves/claims
- Evaluation setup
- Strengths
- Limitations/open gaps
- Direct relevance to our RQs
- Follow-chain (who they cite / who cites them)

End with an initial comparison matrix draft (approach × criteria).

**Do not start Phase 3.**

---

## STEP 5 — PHASE 2: Critical Synthesis & Final Gap Confirmation

### Prompt

Finish PHASE 2.

**1) Produce a synthesis:**
- What patterns dominate the field?
- Where do approaches fail and why?
- Which gaps are truly unaddressed?

**2) Update our:**
- Problem statement
- RQs (if needed)
- Contribution claims (if needed)

**3) Produce a baseline list + metrics list + threat list that will be used in evaluation.**

**4) Output "Master Document v1" in Markdown:**
- Research foundation
- Literature map + comparison tables
- Proposed approach blueprint
- Evaluation plan outline
- Milestones + risks

**Stop. Do not begin Phase 3.**

---

## STEP 6 — PHASE 3: Method / System / Theory Deep Dive

### Prompt

**PHASE 3: Technical Deep Dive**

Based on Master Document v1:

1) Define formal terms/constructs/notation (as needed for my paper type).

2) Specify the method/system architecture:
   - components
   - interfaces
   - data flow
   - assumptions and constraints

3) Provide step-by-step algorithms/procedures (pseudocode if relevant):
   - inputs/outputs
   - steps
   - complexity/resources
   - failure modes

4) Provide the evaluation design:
   - experiments/studies
   - ablations
   - baselines
   - metrics
   - statistical tests (if applicable)

5) Expand "Threats to validity / threat model" appropriate to the domain.

**Stop. Do not write full paper yet.**

---

## STEP 7 — PHASE 4: Full Paper Expansion (Section-by-Section)

### Prompt

**PHASE 4: Full Paper Expansion**

Write each section with:
- purpose
- key claims
- evidence plan
- required figures/tables with caption drafts
- citations needed (placeholders OK)

**Sections:**
1) Introduction
2) Background/Preliminaries
3) Related Work
4) Method/Architecture
5) Evaluation Setup
6) Results
7) Discussion
8) Limitations
9) Conclusion

Stop after section drafts. Do not generate LaTeX yet.

---

## STEP 8 — PHASE 5: Manuscript Output (LaTeX or Doc)

### Prompt

**PHASE 5: Manuscript Generation**

Generate a complete manuscript in [IEEE/ACM/APA/etc] format.

**Rules:**
- Use `\placeholder{}` for missing text
- Use `\todo{}` for actions required
- Use `\result{exp}{TBD}` for results
- Use consistent figure/table labels

Output the full LaTeX (or full structured manuscript text if not LaTeX).

**Stop.**

---

## STEP 9 — PHASE 6: Rigor Upgrade + Reviewer Simulation

### Prompt

**PHASE 6: Academic Rigor Enhancement**

1) Run a claim-evidence audit (every claim must be supported).

2) Identify missing citations + propose where to add them.

3) Stress-test methodology: confounders, threats, failure cases.

4) Write a reviewer-style critique:
   - Major issues (must-fix)
   - Minor issues (nice-to-fix)

5) Provide a prioritized revision plan.

**Stop.**

---

## STEP 10 — PHASE 7: Submission Prep

### Prompt

**PHASE 7: Submission Preparation**

1) Create a venue compliance checklist (format, anonymity, ethics, page limits).

2) Create an artifact plan (code/data/repro steps, README outline).

3) Produce "Author Instructions" listing all placeholders and what is needed to fill them.

4) Produce a final polishing checklist (title/abstract/contributions/figures).

**Stop.**

---

## Optional Micro-Prompts (When You Want Just One Thing)

- "Only sharpen RQs and contribution claims; don't touch anything else."
- "Give 10 baselines and justify each baseline's relevance."
- "Design 6 ablation studies + expected outcomes."
- "Write only the Introduction (top-venue style), 900–1200 words."

## Custom Prompt Generation

If you paste your idea + domain + paper type, I can also generate a ready-to-use Step 0 prompt filled with placeholders tailored to your topic.

## Project Summary

The proposed research focuses on developing a Deep-learning-based framework with UAV hyperspectral & LiDAR images based on tonal variations and structural components for tree species, biodiversity mapping, forest type classifications etc. in Meghalaya. Traditional monitoring methods largely rely on optical or field-based surveys. This study aims to leverage hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and LiDAR from UAV-based sensors and/or satellite sources to enhance the ongoing classification methods. By exploiting the detailed spectral signatures of vegetation, the project aims to accurately classify forest species and assess canopy health. A hybrid deep learning architecture may be developed to model both spectral, spatial and the forest structural parameters for better monitoring and assessment.

### Expected Outcomes
- Fine-grained forest species classification mapping templates
- Operational GIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for integrating with optical information
- Data fusion techniques for improved information extraction

### Scope of Work
1. Development and implementation of advanced hyperspectral and LiDAR based forest species classification system
2. UAV-based data handling and information extraction
3. Data fusion techniques for multi-species identification
4. Ground-based data collection for validation
5. Replicable framework for forest health monitoring

### Linkages to ISRO Space Programme
- Aligned with ISRO's Space Vision 2047
- Leverages hyperspectral data from ISRO's HySIS and AVIRIS-NG missions
- Supports biodiversity assessment, forest resource mapping, and ecological monitoring
- Contributes to AI-driven UAV geospatial analytics
- Complements future hyperspectral/LiDAR satellite missions

### Expected Deliverables
1. Deep Learning Framework for spectral-spatial forest analysis
2. Forest species identification key for species distribution mapping
3. Canopy structure analysis methodology
4. Decision Support System (DSS) integrating UAV data acquisition, processing, and output generation
5. Framework for future integration with ISRO's Earth Observation missions

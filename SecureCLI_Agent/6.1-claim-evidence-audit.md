# Claim-Evidence Audit

**Target:** Systematic audit of all claims in the paper  
**Section:** Phase 6 - Rigor Enhancement  
**Module:** 6.1 - Claim-Evidence Audit

---

## Overview

Module 6.1 performs a systematic audit of all claims made throughout the paper, creating an audit matrix that maps each claim to its evidence source, status, and confidence level. This audit identifies claims lacking primary evidence, flags speculative statements for revision, and ensures that all high/medium confidence claims have pre-registered evidence sources.

**Quality Gate:** ✅ PASSED - All High/Medium confidence claims have pre-registered evidence sources; no claims exceed collected data.

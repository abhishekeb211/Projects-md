## Summary of the Proposed Research

The proposed research focuses on developing a Deep-learning-based framework with UAV hyperspectral & LiDAR images based on tonal variations and structural components for tree species, biodiversity mapping, forest type classifications etc. in Meghalaya. Traditional monitoring methods, largely rely on optical or field-based surveys. This study aims to leverage hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and LiDAR from UAV-based sensors and/or satellite sources to enhance the ongoing classification methods. By exploiting the detailed spectral signatures of vegetation, the project aims to accurately classify forest species and assess canopy health. A hybrid deep learning architecture may be developed to model both spectral, spatial and the forest structural parameters for better monitoring and assessment.

The expected outcomes should include fine-grained forest species classification mapping templates and an operational GIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for integrating with optical information. The data fusion techniques also may be explored to improve the information extraction.
